This app creates an Excel-file dashboard based on the historic data on shippments taken from FedEx, UPS and Canada Post. Since all three carriers don't allow to extract such data via API, this app does everything through the browser.

FedEx blocks the access if it sees the headless browser so I had to use the virtual display.
